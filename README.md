I'm a Motion Designer specializing in creating dynamic and engaging visual content. With a strong interest in interactivity, and a focus on making the day-to-day work of motion designers more efficient, I am currently involved in these After Effects projects:

- **[20+ Scriptlets](https://github.com/evefalcao/EF_After-Effects-Scriptlets)**: 20+ tools that perform multiple repetitive tasks
- **[Anchor Locker](https://github.com/evefalcao/EF_Anchor-Locker)**: Lock layers' Anchor Point anywhere
- **[Manipulate Anchor Point](https://github.com/evefalcao/EF_Manipulate-Anchor-Point)**: Move layers' Anchor Point around

üíº **Available for Freelance**  
I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to reach out if you're looking for a motion designer who brings creativity, technical skill, and a strong understanding of both design and animation.
